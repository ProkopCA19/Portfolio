		<p align="left">The game starts off with 100 players dropping onto a map.  Throughout the course of the game the storm circle will gradually get smaller and smaller-if you get caught outside the storm circle for too long you will die.  Once you have landed your goal is to find as much good "loot" as possible.  Loot can be weapons, objects that give you health, or shields.  Along the way you should also be gathering build-this can help you build a fort around you for protection or put up defensive walls.  Whichever player is left standing at the end of the game wins! This game can also be played in teams of 2 or 4, and sometimes more! </p>
